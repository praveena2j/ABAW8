In this work, we present two audio-visual fusion models : Gated Recursive Joint Cross Attention and Hierarchical Gated Recursive Joint Cross Attention for dimensional emotion recognition. We submitted our results on test set for Valence-arousal challenge of 8th ABAW competition and achieved second place.
